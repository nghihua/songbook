    lyrics: `So you're standing in the parking lot of life
      And you're trying to figure out your fate tonight
      And you hear a sound coming out of the car radio
      Saying "son, if you don't learn, then you will never know"
      So you try to drag your feet down to the bar
      When you startin' to forget just who you are
      And they told you it was written in the stars
      But you've never had a chance to look that far
      Yeah, it's just the way it goes
      Maybe you die young before you're old
      Yeah, it's just the way it is
      Nobody's gonna tell you how to live
      In a world that changes everyday
      It's easy to get lost along the way
      In a world that's never as it seems
      Where people try to buy and sell their dreams
      Where people try to buy and sell their dreams
      Yeah, it's just the way it goes
      Maybe you die young before you're old
      Yeah, it's just the way it is
      Nobody's gonna tell you how to live
      Nobody's gonna tell you how to live
      Nobody's gonna tell you how to live
      Nobody's gonna tell you how to live
      Cause nobody understands just what it is`,
    description: `I listened to this song when I was still lost in life. What to do, who to be, it was all a mystery. You are only ever sure of yourself through trials and errors. It's like you're given a randomized character when you enter this game, and only through time can you figure out its quirks. No detailed description for you, and no one can ever tell you what to do, who to be.`,

    lyrics: `When the sun comes, you're my shade
    When the moon comes, you're a little firefly
    I love you more than I can say
    No I'll never fly away
    When the sun comes, you're my shade
    When the moon comes, you're a little firefly
    I love you more than I can say
    I'm your firefly, I'm your shade
    I wanna live in a house that we've made
    I wanna love you everyday
    And I'll never fly away
    I wanna love you everyday`,

    lyrics: `LILLIAN:
    Oh, the sun will rise in the morning
    Or so I’m told, but who knows?
    You could win a million bucks in the morning
    And then get rolled by a mob of stinkin’ hobos
    
    Good news: you can’t lose
    When you tell Mr. Blues that you choose to keep going
    
    TITUS:
    We’ll never stop, we’ll keep on moving forward
    Even if we don’t know what we’re moving toward
    
    BOTH:
    They say life’s too short, but they’re wrong
    It’s so long
    So the only way to go is to just go on
    
    GANGLY ORPHAN JEFF:
    Keep a smile in your pocket when the wolf is rat-a-tattin’ at the door
    Just lock it tight
    Keep a dream in your horn, and you’ll never ever want for more
    Unless you’re in a knife fight
    
    Chin high, spit in the eye
    Of the folks who can’t stop laughing at the stupid things you’ve done
    
    Don’t ever stop, even though your heart is breaking
    Don’t look over your shoulder at the love you left behind
    They say life’s too short, but they’re wrong
    It’s so long
    Sometimes the only way to go is to just go on`,
